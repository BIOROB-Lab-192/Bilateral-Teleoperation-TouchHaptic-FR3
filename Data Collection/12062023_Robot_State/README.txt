Test Date: 12-06-2023

Location: ENGR 192 SJSU

Purpose:The purpose of this testing was to gather information about the measured link-side torque and measured joint position of the Franka Research 3 available in the ENGR 192. 

File Information:
1. FR3_DataCollect_12062023.m: Code used to command the Franka Reaserch 3 robot along a trajectory using 150 total point-to-point movements to 3 defined waypoints. The link-side torque, joint positions and joint velocities were recorded.

2. FR3_DataCollect_12062023_slow.mat: MATLAB data collected while running "FR3_DataCollect_12062023.m" at the "slow speed".

3. FR3_DataCollect_12062023_fast.mat: MATLAB data collected while running "FR3_DataCollect_12062023.m" at the "fast speed".

4. FR3_DataPlot_12062023.m: Used to plot the torque data from FR3_DataCollect_12062023_slow.mat.
